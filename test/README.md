# Pendant Test Suite

This directory contains a comprehensive test suite for the Pendant emergency communication device. The tests cover all major components of the system, from individual modules to integration between components.

## Test Structure Overview

The test suite is organized into various test modules covering different aspects of the system:

1. **Authentication Tests** - Tests for the Auth module to ensure proper token generation, verification and role-based access control.

2. **Rate Limiter Tests** - Tests for the token bucket implementation to ensure proper rate limiting functionality.

3. **CRDT Tests** - Tests for Conflict-free Replicated Data Types used for collaborative editing.

4. **Chat Module Tests** - Tests for the core chat functionality, including user, room, and message operations.

5. **File Handling Tests** - Tests to ensure proper file upload handling, validation, and security measures.

6. **Web/Channel Tests** - Tests for Phoenix Channels and web components used for real-time communication.

7. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end tests for authentication flows, chat functionality, and file sharing.

## Running Tests

For production code, you would typically run the test suite using:

```bash
mix test
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite aims to provide thorough coverage of the following functionality:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Token generation, verification, and role-based access control
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm to prevent resource abuse
- **CRDT Operations**: Add, remove, and update operations on various CRDT types
- **Chat Functionality**: User, room, and message operations
- **File Handling**: Secure file uploads with proper validation and constraints
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket channels for live updates
- **Security Measures**: Input validation, error handling, and proper authorization

## Future Test Enhancements

For a more comprehensive test suite in a production environment, consider adding:

1. **Property-based tests** for CRDT operations to verify conflict resolution
2. **Load tests** to verify performance under emergency conditions
3. **Security tests** to verify proper input sanitization and authorization
4. **Concurrency tests** to verify behavior under simultaneous user actions
5. **Network partition tests** to verify behavior in limited connectivity scenarios
